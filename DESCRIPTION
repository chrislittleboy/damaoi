Description: Dams have environmental and social impacts, both positive and
    negative. Impact evaluations today have no consistent way of
    specifying where was impacted by dams. Reservoirs innundate land.
    Downstream flow is reduced. Upstream fish populations are lower. But
    when measuring impacts, how close to the reservoir should you
    consider?How far downstream or upstream? This package formalises ways
    of creating an area of interest around a dam. Reservoirs are
    standardised to match satellite-observed surface water area. Upstream
    and downstream rivers are determined using elevation data and
    accumulated river flow. The package lets users create areas of
    interest around a dam according to set principles. This is an
    essential step before being able understand the comparative impact of
    different dams.
