This version is the first development version of the code, tested on only a few dams.
We expect many changes, in response to testing the code against different real-world examples.
Rivers and dams are complex. 
While the code has numerous safeguards to ensure that it works for reservoirs with different geometries, there will be edge cases.
This might include, for example, dams which are parts of systems.
Challenging geometries, for example reservoirs with islands within them which themselves have lakes.
Rivers which flow adjacent to other rivers with a different trajectory.
It is possible to adapt the code to almost any conceivable case, but difficult to know what adaptations will be required in advance.
If you find a dam for which the code does not work, please post an issue to the github page, or submit a pull request and join us as a contributor!
